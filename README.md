# Introduction
This example aims to analyse dynamic performance of cement/concrete-based beam structures. 
The Primitive minimal surface was employed as reinforcement of cement-based beams. 
The TPMS-Primitive reinforcement scaffolds and molds are printed with thermoplastic Polylactic Acid (PLA) material, then pouring cementitious mortar to cast the beams
